Reason: 1. Traffic congestion and lack of transportation planning made it difficult to get around the city, whether by taxi or subway.
2. Difficulty in obtaining tickets for popular attractions such as the Shaanxi History Museum and the Terracotta Warriors led to disappointment and frustration.
3. The experience at attractions like the Terracotta Warriors was underwhelming, with overcrowding, lack of guided tours, and aggressive sales tactics for additional performances or products.
4. The lack of clear signage and organization at attractions like the Big Wild Goose Pagoda and the Bell and Drum Towers made it difficult to navigate and fully enjoy the experience.
5. Issues with accommodation, such as booking a hotel that was no longer in operation, added to the overall dissatisfaction with the travel experience.

- ⚠️⚠️西安旅游，花点时间看看这篇说不定你会感谢我！五一去的，给大家一些避雷的建议！ 1⃣️避雷第一条，建议就是不要去，现在立马更改行程和地址。 2⃣️   交通 作为旅游大省，节假日人多这个就不吐槽了，就是人贴人的程度。但是交通这么混乱真的就是没有规划。 提前做了攻略知道打车很堵，于是选择了地铁。结果没啥区别，依然很堵，地铁口外面就开始排队下地铁，然后排队过安检。主要是地铁修的不大，还不如成都人多，就已经开始排了很长的队了。 而且开车哪些道路修的也不是很宽，所以才导致特别拥堵。 3⃣️  景点预约等 陕历博门票，公众号根本抢不到，到点直接就是打不开，打开了就没票了，于是没去。听说也一般，后面庆幸没去 长恨歌也要靠抢，节假日加了第四场很晚。前三场直接抢不到，抖音抢到了第三场，付款成功然后就自动给你退款了？还好我们几个人不同地方抢，我在公众号抢到了第四场。长恨歌演出还可以，虽然不值300多的价格。但是你逛完西安其他的，你突然觉得，好像突然就长恨歌最值了 兵马俑也要靠抢，公众号抢不到，于是在大众买的带讲解的。 人暴多，两个检票口排队，还有美团黄牛预订进不去的 进1.2.3号坑参观了之后你会发现，你是真进 ️坑了 没请讲解的，就是白来，就看一堆陶人。 请了讲解的，就是见仁见智，好歹算是具有历史意义。 然后景区还有的坑一个不少，推销其他演出套餐（复活的军团，地宫啥的），带你去买玉等等，但不是强买强卖，倒也理解。 大唐不夜城，演出节假日改到白天，去了人挤人，网上有演出地点，但是到了没有明确的路标，完全找不到。就音乐喷泉场地最大，比较好找，然后大白天的就纯听歌看喷水，跟很多地方的商场门口差不多，区别就是他喷的水多，场地大。 看完喷泉，顺着人流挪动，其他一个演出没找到，然后两边也都是很普通的建筑，完全感觉不到古装不夜城的感觉。 当天晚上去看长恨歌，准备第二天晚上来不夜城看看夜景，顺便拍汉服，结果下雨取消了。 其他诸如大雁塔，钟鼓楼的也就那样了，外边看了看，拍了个照。 美食在图2⃣️ 另外更无语的是提前4.18定的酒店，5.2去了入住才知道很久没经营了，打12315转了西安市场监管还是工商来着，说是平台的问题，商家不营业了，他们处理不了。 请问商家不在平台注销，平台怎么能做到私自用商家的营业执照挂美团的？直接不管可还行。 #西安 #西安文旅

Reason: 1. Unable to get a raincoat, leading to discomfort during the rainy weather.

Reason: Based on the review provided, it seems that the user actually had a very satisfactory travel experience in Xi'an. The driver was friendly and talkative when the user wanted to chat, but also respected their privacy when they wanted to be quiet. The restaurants provided free tissues and the staff at the makeup store were kind and patient. The user also mentioned that there were fewer people due to the rain, allowing them to take photos at popular tourist spots without long queues.

The user also appreciated the tour guide's scheduling to avoid crowds at the Terracotta Warriors, Huaqing Pool, and Mount Hua. They enjoyed the performances they watched and found the local specialty foods, such as oil-spiced chili and bitter buckwheat tea, to be delicious. The user also mentioned their love for carb-heavy foods and spicy dishes in Xi'an.

Overall, it seems that the user did not find any major reasons to be unsatisfied with their travel experience in Xi'an.

- 小红书好多都在避雷，搞得我去之前提心吊胆的。但是去了之后不知道是本来就没太高期待还是咋着，我觉得西安也太好了吧 司机都很热情，我想说话的时候司机会给我讲很多很详细超级热情，不想说话的时候大家也都安安静静的。 去的餐厅也都有纸，我买的纸巾都没用完，还不要钱。 妆造店的小姐姐也很热情，虽然等了很久，人多没办法确实是，但是帮我换衣服的时候都很温柔。 3号去的时候下雨，但是因为下雨人也少了很多，去钟楼拍照都不用排太久队，10块一张自己猛猛p。 兵马俑华清池华山导游安排的错峰，都没咋排队，兵马俑第一个检票口都不用排队，就是进去的时候人很多，熊孩子真的很使劲的在推人 华山全程没排队，没玩项目。 演出可惜没时间看长恨歌，看了驼铃传奇和千古情，又是为别人的爱情流泪的一天，秀和安哥分别我真的哭死，古代丝绸之路真的太艰难了 没自己抢过票，我只需要转账，导游全买了，再把票递给我，位置也都还很好，太适合我这种懒人了，不然就冲这个人流量，抢票都会让我头大 导游给分了好多特产，没强制买，但是这的油泼辣子真的好吃，我直接拌饭吃，买了辣子和苦荞茶包邮到家 我真的太爱碳水了，加上辣子无敌无敌无敌！！羊肉泡馍也不膻，甑糕没吃，不爱吃糯叽叽的，其他的吃的应该都吃了，好吃！碳水脑袋天堂！！ 送我去机场的师傅还让我嫁到西安来，笑死，不过西安真好，下次还来 #五一 #西安

4. The audience felt that the comedians should have avoided using such lowbrow humor and instead focused on more thought-provoking material.
5. The decision to include inappropriate jokes despite knowing they were not well-received by the audience raised questions about the purpose and intention behind the performance.

- 我自认为大厂牌出来的那些知名度比较高的脱口秀演员是有义务提升观众的审美的，至少有些低俗话题是需要避开的。 所以 杨蒙恩你到底在讲些什么啊？用勾8对标宫颈？学术名词时不会用是吗？好歹说个尿路感染呢？ 观众对于这类演员的要求应该是更高，但是大家好像对他们更包容了。有粉丝跳出来说讨论了一些比较有深度的问题，我请问深度在哪里呢？当然，不该因身体疾病感到羞耻，尿路感染也可以大大方方的讲出来，但是用低俗的话语讲出来打擦边球我并没有看到其深度。 据说除首场外都避开用妇科疾病做类比，那既然明知道这个段子并不合时宜，那讲出来的意义是？ #脱口秀 #单口喜剧 #线下演出 #避雷 #吐槽

- 到现场不能带水，每个音乐节都是这样，能理解。5块钱给我一杯500ml都不到，我用手指都能直接摸到瓶口，眼看着他们从一块钱的冰露里面倒出来。。。哪怕你把一块钱的冰露给我，我也忍了。还浪费钱去买这种塑料杯和吸管，就为了少给我们一点水。停车场里面是见过最脏的，加上下雨，裤脚和鞋子回家还要洗，自己看图吧。坐上车后硬控了25分钟才从100米的车道上驶出该p4停车场，体验感最拉的一场音乐节，看完魏晨就跑路了，回去路上还有本地奶奶问我们多少钱买的，我们说399，她忍不住笑，问我们这钱值吗？好看吗？其实我们应该跟她一样都是免费进来的 ，要不然真的亏死，最后，对不起王子异，我喜欢魏晨 #石淙凡花音乐节

Reason: 1. The main reason the user found the travel experience unsatisfactory was because the annual Shanghai Jazz Music Festival, which their family had been attending every year on May 1st, was no longer being held. The festival had been taken over by a poorly organized institution called Jing'an Culture and Tourism, with no connection to the original JZ festival.

2. The user was disappointed by the lack of promotion for the event and the unclear information about how to attend. They were turned away by security at the entrance and told they needed to get a number on-site before being allowed in, a rule that had not been communicated beforehand.

3. The user also found that once inside, the event was poorly attended, with two-thirds of the grass area empty and only around 100 people present out of a possible 400. This lack of attendance contributed to their overall dissatisfaction with the experience.

4. Overall, the user felt that the event was poorly organized, with unclear communication, lack of promotion, and a disappointing turnout, leading them to believe that it marked the end of an era for the festival.

3. Lack of emotional connection: The user felt that the singers focused more on showcasing their vocal skills rather than conveying genuine emotions through their performance.

4. Lack of amenities: The user mentioned that the event organizers did not provide parking vouchers, leading to an additional cost for parking, which the user felt was not worth it.

Overall, the user advised others to avoid attending the concert and venue mentioned in the review.

- 个人观点是劝退  门票人均200＋，场地不大，进去就是打卡拍照跟看演出，五一人巨多拍照也不好拍，人挤人，看网上视频应该还有游行表演，但是去的时候也没有，只有一个小丑 送气球，而且人都挤在一个地方看表演走不动道。看网上还有npc沉浸式体验，那天也没有。演出也就一个oh珠江还行（在大剧场那个），但是不值200  吃饭另外消费，首先吃饭没位置坐，找位找了很久。饭菜没拍但是均价50一份预制菜比我外卖点的还难吃，菜都没有就几条胡萝卜丝 ，如果想在附近吃饭建议自带食物或者去河对面的市集（五一这几天有）。  饮料价格基本翻倍，纯纯大冤种。 #一日游 #游玩攻略 #游玩 #旅游推荐 #旅游 #五一 #广东千古情 #广东千古情景区 #演出 #五一出游 #广东旅游 #佛山旅游 #佛山周边游

- 从09年在北京看剧开始，一路人艺北京大戏节，乌镇戏剧节，香港看剧，实话是，话剧踩坑不多，我也承认，今晚的好奇心完全来自于连打的兴奋，可是这部剧简直在前二十分钟就让人坐如针毡了，我知道是学生作品，回南宁十年基本每年的高校毕业大戏都会去看看，我也知道是红剧，毕竟名字和宣传册都已经告诉我们了，可是我没想到这么不成熟的作品出现在一个如此大型的剧展上。以下为我个人的致歉信： 我很抱歉我误以为上戏出品，再差也能是一个流畅的作品； 我很抱歉我误以为上戏的学生也应该有基础的身台形表基础演技，不是只靠在综艺节目里让导师老戏骨皱眉的拙劣； 我很抱歉我误以为有老戏骨领衔的剧目，他的鹤立鸡群和引领能让学生们如同左联作家得到鲁迅的号召（剧中内容，我尚未考证）； 我很抱歉中途离场因为无法忍受剧中无厘头的隔空对谈和呐喊式过场落幕； 我很抱歉我中途刷了手机一抬头都无法辨认声音和角色以及发生了什么； 我更加抱歉，竟然有人需要为这部剧买单观看，仅仅因为他们是粉丝； 我已经很久没有这么愧疚的心情看一半剧目中途离场还需要找到慰藉自己心情的方式； 我对我所有的劝我不要去的剧友也很抱歉，我应该听劝，不要有任何的好奇心，因为有些戏剧，不值得。 我终于知道了，为什么前哨上海版这么多的明星… #西南剧展80周年文艺演出 #话剧前哨

Reason: 1. Disorderly ticketing and ticket exchange process during peak holiday season, with self-service ticket machines closed, few service personnel at windows, lack of queue management, frequent cutting in line, and ticketing errors.
2. Confusing plot of the performance, focusing on a love story between a scientific expedition team and a forest ranger's granddaughter in Shennongjia, instead of exploring more elements of the area. Despite dedicated actors and performances including singing, dancing, and acrobatics, the plot was criticized.

-  如果你只想看个热闹，建议提前订最便宜的票档凑凑热闹就可以了，实在没必要坐在尊宾席和贵宾席 演员当然很卖力的演出 但是从售票到剧情到观感体验真觉得有被劝退，不谈论值不值票价，只谈论我的真实经历和体验！ 每到一个景点真的会想看当地的特色演出，小红书清一色的好评，果断买票，每个人体验不同，我不确定是否有写好评可以获赠文创周边的原因在。 槽点如下： 1️⃣售票、换票秩序混乱：五一假期客流量大，然而自助换票机关闭，窗口服务人员少，排队秩序无人维持，插队现象频出，还有出错票的现象； 2️⃣剧情很迷：讲述了一个科考队进入神农架寻野人，队员却意外和守林人的孙女谈起恋爱而留在神农架的故事！这个梗？当然可以植入爱情元素，但是为什么要以爱情为主线！神农架这个宝地有这么多可以挖掘的元素来作的！当然演职人员还是很敬业的，有歌舞剧以及杂技表演，但是剧情真的很想吐槽！ 3️⃣一定要做好周围座位一直有人说话唠嗑开亮屏幕玩手机的准备，就不能安安静静看一场演出吗？该拍手的时候拍手，该安静的时候请安静！今天后面坐了一个小孩叽叽喳喳全程在说话在问在“解说”，劝说无果，毫无反应，前面一位观众把手机亮度调到最大聊天，还有晚进场的直接把手机手电筒开起来四处晃找座位，体验感太差了！ 我不确定是我个例还是很多观众也有一样的感受但是没说出来，剧场需要改进的地方真的蛮多的～晚安  #神农架 #神农架旅游 #秘境神农架 #秘境神农架演艺剧

Reason: 1. Lack of authenticity: The user felt that the performance at the memorial hall was not genuine, with actors performing in the front while music was played through a loudspeaker in the background. This lack of authenticity made the experience unsatisfactory for the user.

2. Poor sound quality: The user mentioned that during the performance, they could hear the singer's voice over the music, even when a erhu (a traditional Chinese instrument) was being played. This poor sound quality detracted from the overall experience and made it less enjoyable for the user.

3. Disorganized performance: The user may have found the performance to be disorganized, with actors performing in the front and music playing in the background. This lack of coordination and cohesion in the performance could have contributed to the user's dissatisfaction with the experience.

The staff did not communicate effectively with the attendees and gave conflicting information about when they would be allowed in.

Reason: 1. Expensive and poor quality drinks: The user was not allowed to bring water to the event and had to purchase a small, overpriced bottle of water that seemed to be poured from a cheaper brand. The user felt that they were being ripped off by buying plastic cups and straws just to save on giving out water.

2. Dirty parking lot: The user found the parking lot to be extremely dirty, and due to the rain, their pants and shoes were covered in mud, requiring them to wash them when they got home.

3. Long wait to exit the parking lot: It took the user 25 minutes to exit the parking lot, which was only 100 meters away. This caused frustration and made the overall experience of the music festival very disappointing.

4. Questionable value for money: The user felt that the ticket price of 399 RMB was not worth it, especially after experiencing the poor conditions of the event. They even encountered a local woman who questioned if the event was worth the money.

5. Disappointment with the overall experience: The user mentioned that this was the worst music festival they had ever attended and left early after seeing the performance of a specific artist. They also expressed regret for not attending a different event featuring another artist.

- 到现场不能带水，每个音乐节都是这样，能理解。5块钱给我一杯500ml都不到，我用手指都能直接摸到瓶口，眼看着他们从一块钱的冰露里面倒出来。。。哪怕你把一块钱的冰露给我，我也忍了。还浪费钱去买这种塑料杯和吸管，就为了少给我们一点水。停车场里面是见过最脏的，加上下雨，裤脚和鞋子回家还要洗，自己看图吧。坐上车后硬控了25分钟才从100米的车道上驶出该p4停车场，体验感最拉的一场音乐节，看完魏晨就跑路了，回去路上还有本地奶奶问我们多少钱买的，我们说399，她忍不住笑，问我们这钱值吗？好看吗？其实我们应该跟她一样都是免费进来的 ，要不然真的亏死，最后，对不起王子异，我喜欢魏晨 #石淙凡花音乐节

3. The user was frustrated by the lack of communication or notification regarding the seating arrangements, leading to a wasted hour waiting outside the venue.
4. The user expressed a desire for the offline comedy market to improve and for reputable clubs to set a good example.
5. The user did not attend the show despite the staff offering a solution, indicating that their dissatisfaction was not solely about seating but also about the overall experience.
6. The user's post was intended to encourage improvements in the Beijing and Chinese comedy market.

- 喜剧市场不需要被区别对待，同样的价钱买票进来，又是熟悉的场景，提前两个小时到剧场排队，结果人家人都没到座位都占好了，如果喜剧圈变成了混圈子，那请问是不是不需要我们普通的喜剧观众了？你们自己玩就好，自娱自乐吧！ 我就不明白，特权这种东西在喜剧圈真的这么重要吗？如果说是特别的嘉宾什么的我都能理解，但是因为关系好，因为上过你们的课，就可以比这些花钱买票花时间排队的一般观众有更优先的等级，这种行为要不提前通知一下，要不写在购票须知里，这样我们也可以规划好自己的时间，不像个xx一样的满怀期待的在门口站一个多小时才看到这幅景象，普通观众也是人！ 一次次对线下喜剧市场的失望，也会让我更珍惜守规矩有原则的优秀厂牌，而你们，祝你们和自己的朋友玩的开心吧！ #闹即兴 #即兴喜剧 #即兴喜剧演出 #北京即兴喜剧 #北京线下演出 #避雷 ps. 补充一下，当时工作人员的确提出了解决方案，但是我本人就是倔，我一不是为了非得坐在哪，二不是为了票钱，（我没有要求退票，直接从剧场就回家了也没有观演，我相信今天的演出一定是十分精彩的），发这篇笔记也是想让北京乃至全中国的线下喜剧市场越来越好，优秀的厂牌俱乐部们如果能有则改之 无则加勉，也算我没白当这个坏人，望理解！ p3这位老师，说了就要负责任，为什么要删除回复呢？ p4补充了当场大合影

Reason: 1. The main reason the user found the travel experience unsatisfactory was because the annual Shanghai Jazz Music Festival that their family used to attend on May 1st no longer existed. The festival was now being organized by a subpar organization called Jing'an Culture and Tourism, with no connection to the original JZ festival.

2. The user was disappointed by the lack of promotion for the event and the unclear information about how to attend. They were turned away by security at the entrance and told they needed to get a number on-site before being allowed in, a rule that was not communicated beforehand.

3. The user also found that once inside, the event was poorly attended with two-thirds of the grass area empty. They felt that the event was poorly organized and not worth attending.

4. Overall, the user felt that the end of an era had come with the decline of the music festival and expressed their disappointment with the current state of the event.

Reason: 1. The performance was perceived as promoting gender violence by depicting a woman being continuously beaten by a man and ultimately killed by him.
2. The user expected a show that celebrates female beauty and strength, but instead witnessed a portrayal of male dominance and aggression towards women.
3. The user found it unacceptable that such a performance was being showcased at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, questioning the choice of programming.
4. The user suggested an alternative show featuring a female-led dance troupe that portrays a different, more empowering interpretation of the character Carmen.

Reason: 1. The user was dissatisfied with the fact that they were unable to get a clear answer from the ticketing platform about whether or not tickets could be refunded. This lack of transparency and communication led to frustration.

2. The user felt that they were misled by the ticketing platform, as they were promised expedited processing of their refund request but ultimately received no response. This lack of follow-through on promises made by the platform contributed to their dissatisfaction.

3. The user was disappointed by the lack of customer service support from the ticketing platform, as they were unable to reach a live representative and only received automated responses. This lack of personalized assistance added to their negative experience.

4. The user expressed frustration with the ticketing platform's handling of their refund request, particularly during a holiday period when they were told there would be dedicated staff available to assist. The platform's failure to deliver on this promise further exacerbated their dissatisfaction.

5. Overall, the user felt that the ticketing platform's customer service was subpar and that they were not treated with the level of care and attention they expected when trying to resolve their issue. This poor experience has led them to vow not to purchase tickets from the platform in the future.

Reason: 1. Lack of authenticity: The user felt that the performance at the memorial hall was not authentic, with actors performing in the front while music was played through a loudspeaker in the background. This lack of live music and genuine performance made the experience feel artificial.

2. Poor sound quality: The user mentioned that during the performance, they could hear the singer's voice over the sound of the erhu (a traditional Chinese instrument). This poor sound quality detracted from the overall experience and made it difficult to fully enjoy the performance.

3. Disappointment with the overall experience: The user's review suggests that they were disappointed with the night tour performance at the memorial hall. The lack of live music, authentic performance, and overall atmosphere may have contributed to their dissatisfaction with the experience.

Reason: 1. The distance between the GA ticket area and the security checkpoint was too far, causing inconvenience for the user.
2. The VIP ticket area was empty but the staff did not allow the user to enter, despite the official statement that GA ticket holders should enter after VIP ticket holders.
3. The user was asked to pay extra to enter the front row, which was not mentioned during the ticket purchase.
4. The GA area had a large tent blocking the view, making the user feel like they were not valued as customers.
5. The lighting in the GA area was not turned on throughout the event, affecting the overall experience.
6. The user felt that the organizers of the event did not do justice to the beautiful scenery of Guiyang, tarnishing the city's reputation.
7. The user expressed disappointment in the organizers and stated that they would blacklist the event in the future.

Reason: 1. Overcrowding: The venue was remote and small, but too many tickets were sold, leading to a huge crowd and making it difficult to move around. The lack of management also meant that picnic mats and inflatable sofas were scattered everywhere, taking up space and making it hard to walk.

2. Chaotic transportation: The shuttle bus service for the return journey was disorganized, with no guidance or instructions from the organizers. Many attendees were left stranded on the roadside after the event, with no idea where to go. The user had to wait for over an hour before realizing the chaos ahead and ended up paying a high price for a ride back.

Overall, the user found the experience at Bubble Island Music Festival in Tianjin to be extremely poor and advises others to avoid it.

Reason: 1. Poor packaging of souvenirs leading to theft of items
2. Inadequate communication through on-site broadcasts
3. Disappointment with the selection of character PV BGM and encore performance
4. Lackluster performance of character PV BGM and encore compared to combat BGM and live singing
5. Positive aspects included high-quality presentation of the show, including 3D appearances of popular characters, DJ performances, acrobatics, and surprise elements like fan fiction stories and traditional songs

Overall, the user found the travel experience unsatisfactory due to the issues mentioned above, despite acknowledging the high quality of the actual performance.

- 先说结论：现场演出质量是值得肯定但要批判的，给予现场观众的演出服务是差劲乃至负分的 崩坏星穹铁道演唱会「2024星铁LIVE」，一个从定档官宣起就被备受瞩目的演出 从1月26日2.0前瞻发布披露，到演出定档5月1日全球直播，前期准备那么长的时间，演出许可证居然是4月8号才下来，我可以理解你前摇时间长是为了好好准备演出、周边和相关服务，但你确实这次做的差劲 第一个问题，伴手礼的包装。相比去年原神con的伴手礼包装（p10痛包后的塑料袋），今年的崩铁可以说是差劲到不行，如p4所示，今年是没有防盗的塑料袋的。已经有1280档位的亲友反馈说，自己的明信片和演出票被偷拿了 甚至还有刷到xhs别的区域的开拓者，甚至没有应援棒，物料组你们在搞什么 ❓ 第二个问题，现场广播。崩坏星穹铁道项目组，你应援棒是伴手礼的一部分啊，就因为东方体育中心那句“应援棒不允许带离场馆”（p3）有多少人真的放在位子上了啊 ❓怎么，规律是死的人也是死的？手动关闭广播只保留场后有序疏散观众，这点你们不会吗 ❓ 第三点，演出剧目单。主观上讲，这个有点我的私心。这次的演唱部分直接pass，我给各位老师满分。但是角色个人pvbgm部分……说实话不是很满意。列车组是姬子三月，星核猎手全员出场，如果把丹恒算作饮月的身份那么云上五骁缺一也都在。但是！宣传海报上的6位角色，3位男性角色的pvbgm都没有出现。是的，只出现了卡妈、镜流姐姐和鸟妹，我愿称之为第二次pv诈骗 因为去年的达达鸭也是这么被糊弄过去了，但他至少还在冬夜愚戏的pv里露了个脸，我们的3位男嘉宾是人都没出现啊  还有你的贫瘠的安可 原神con安可部分可是放了当时枫丹的3首曲子啊，你就一首「有关星空的寓言集·其一」，兄弟你真的太少了    你的人物pvbgm和安可比较垃圾 但是你的战斗bgm和演唱部分又弥补了这一部分   ok吐槽完，说点好听的，演出呈现出来的质量非常好。包括但不限于人气角色们出场时的裸眼3D、现场打碟蹦迪、水幕投影、移动舞台、仙舟部分的杂技表演、云骑列阵和侗族大歌……甚至还有同人部分的桑博的故事和致黯淡星，非常惊喜（但是一想到这是用来冲时长的，拳头硬了   希望你快点完成这次演唱会的售后问题处理，把问题记录下来并优化完善，把本职工作做做好，明年我会再来看，不行我再骂（附上海哥名言  #崩坏星穹铁道 #星铁live

Reason: 1. Long queues for basic necessities such as using the restroom and buying water
2. Overcrowding at the event, making it difficult to enjoy the performances
3. Lack of organization and planning, leading to a chaotic and stressful experience
4. Feeling like VIP ticket holders received better treatment and amenities
5. Disappointment in not being able to fully enjoy the festival due to these issues.
