Scenic area A is a National AAAAA level tourist attraction in China, where the scenery is unique and beautiful. Managers manipulated tour guides to arrange forced consumption. The tour guides added shopping items to tourists’ bags without authorization, and tourists who did not spend money were verbally abused by tour guides. Tourists were not allowed to leave unless they had spent at least 10,000 yuan on souvenirs. This compulsory shopping has aroused great social concern, and the annual visits to Scenic Area A are expected to decrease by 40%.
